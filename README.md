Python tools for data analytics.

I will upload the scripts soon, I just realized that I have a strong dependency with the tutorials and cases.  So I need to clean up things a little bit and create basic tutorials.

For the moment the tutorials are targeted to data obtained from DAKOTA-OpenFOAM, and I am working in data from DAKOTA-SU2 as well.  I hope to come out with a single format for doing the data analytics independently of the tools used.
